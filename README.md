# DU-Warpcell-Map
 
 Setup Instructions:
 1. Connect a programming board to a screen (S, M, or Transparent L have been tested) and to your ships core.
 2. Once connections are made, copy the raw code form the du-warpcell-map.json file and go to your programming board.
 3. At your programming board go Advanced > Paste Lua configration from clipboard
 4. Turn on screen and programming board.
 
 Usage Instructions:
 To use the touch screen, do not have a tool equipped.
 To get warp cell cost, you must sit in your ships control seat so that mass can be calculated.
     - Construct "Weight" will be displayed in tons (even though it's actually calculated in tonnes)
     - Est. Warp Cost will display the warp cells you will need for ONE WAY travel.
